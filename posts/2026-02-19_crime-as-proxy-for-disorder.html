<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Scott Alexander examines the disconnect between public perception that crime is rampant and actual crime statistics, which show historically low rates. His thesis: people are actually concerned about <em>disorder</em> — litter, graffiti, homelessness, shoplifting, tent encampments — but use &ldquo;crime&rdquo; as a proxy because complaining about disorder directly risks social criticism. He systematically reviews data on each form of disorder, finding that most metrics are either improving long-term or only modestly above recent lows (e.g., shoplifting ~33% above 2005 lows, homelessness ~25% above generational lows).</p>
<h2>Key Insights</h2>
<p>The most interesting move is the three-way framing of competing explanations: (1) a recent 2020-era bump in disorder that hasn&rsquo;t reversed despite crime declining, (2) the impossibility of pre-1950 disorder comparisons since the material prerequisites (plastic, spray paint) didn&rsquo;t exist, and (3) the mid-20th century as an anomalous &ldquo;golden age&rdquo; of low disorder that created unrealistic baselines. The data quality problem is itself revealing — we have decent crime statistics but remarkably poor disorder statistics, which Alexander argues is partly because disorder is harder to measure and partly because there&rsquo;s less institutional incentive to track it. The shoplifting section is particularly good at separating signal from noise, cutting through retail industry claims of a &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; by showing the FBI data tells a much more modest story.</p>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>This is Alexander at his most useful — taking a widely-held intuition (&ldquo;everything is getting worse&rdquo;), steelmanning it, and then subjecting it to actual data. The proxy argument is compelling: it explains why crime policy debates feel so disconnected from crime data, and why &ldquo;tough on crime&rdquo; rhetoric resonates even when crime is falling. The main limitation is that disorder <em>does</em> plausibly have nonlinear effects on quality of life that aggregate statistics miss — a single tent encampment near your commute route affects your perception more than a citywide average would predict. Alexander acknowledges this but doesn&rsquo;t fully engage with it. Still, the piece is a valuable corrective to catastrophist narratives and a reminder that vibes-based assessment of social trends is unreliable.</p>
