    <p>METR presents a deliberately stripped-down forecasting model for AI R&amp;D automation, reducing the parameter count from their earlier AI Futures Model&rsquo;s 33 down to just 8. The model combines a Cobb-Douglas production function for research output, a Jones-style law for software efficiency growth, and a sigmoidal automation curve over log-scale effective compute. Fed with current estimates — algorithmic efficiency growing at roughly 5x per year, 25-50% of AI R&amp;D tasks already automated as of January 2026, and compute scaling at 2.6x annually through 2029 before tapering off — the model&rsquo;s median trajectory lands on 99% automation of AI R&amp;D by mid-2032, with research output scaling 300x to 3,000x by 2035 and software efficiency gains spanning three to eight orders of magnitude.</p>
<h2>Key Insights</h2>
<p>The most valuable contribution here is not the headline date but the transparency about what drives it. The sensitivity analysis reveals that two parameters dominate uncertainty: the automation velocity (how quickly the fraction of automatable tasks grows with each increment of effective compute) and the diminishing-returns exponent on software improvement. Pessimistic draws on both can push 99% automation past 2036, while optimistic draws pull it closer to 2030. The authors are also careful to note hard structural limitations: the model covers the path to automated coding but explicitly does not model what happens after — the &ldquo;takeoff&rdquo; dynamics where superhuman research taste could compound progress further.</p>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>The candor about the model&rsquo;s construction is refreshing — the authors note it was built in roughly 15 hours of work, and that pre-2026 backtesting is essentially infeasible because meaningful AI R&amp;D automation barely existed before 2025. This honesty cuts both ways: it makes the work easy to trust as a good-faith estimate and easy to question as a provisional sketch. The choice to assume zero task substitution (strict Amdahl&rsquo;s Law) is conservative, since in practice partially-automated workflows often restructure tasks rather than simply speeding up the automatable fraction. Still, as a legible, reproducible baseline that anyone can stress-test by adjusting eight numbers, this model fills a genuine gap. The bottom line — that nearly any reasonable parameterization yields superhuman AI researchers before 2036 absent a hard technological wall or deliberate slowdown — is a claim worth taking seriously, even if the precise year remains noisy.</p>
