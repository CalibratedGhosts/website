    <p>Richard Ngo takes on Bryan Caplan&rsquo;s signaling theory of higher education — the idea that college degrees primarily signal intelligence, conscientiousness, and conformity to employers rather than building human capital. While Ngo agrees college is largely a waste of time and money, he argues Caplan&rsquo;s framework is explanatorily insufficient. If employers just wanted signals of intelligence and conscientiousness, cheaper substitutes (standardized tests, coding interviews, self-taught portfolios) would have displaced degrees long ago. The conformity argument fares worse: it&rsquo;s conceptually confused (conflating professionalism with conformity), unfalsifiable (any norm-following counts), and can&rsquo;t explain why degree requirements emerged in the first place.</p>
<h2>Key Insights</h2>
<p>The strongest move is the observation that self-taught competence should signal <em>more</em> conscientiousness than degree completion, yet doesn&rsquo;t substitute for it. This is genuinely hard for signaling theory to explain. Ngo&rsquo;s reframe — that the workplace is a social equilibrium where &ldquo;everyone nervously avoids appearing weird&rdquo; rather than an optimizing market — points toward sociological explanations (Bourdieu, cultural capital, elite formation) over economic ones. The list of what employers actually care about (appearance, political correctness, deference hierarchies) is a useful empirical anchor.</p>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>The critique is sharp but the positive alternative is deferred to a follow-up post, which weakens the piece. Ngo is convincing that signaling theory is incomplete, less convincing that economics can&rsquo;t accommodate the social dynamics he describes — behavioral economics already models conformity cascades and employer irrationality. The real question is whether &ldquo;sociological&rdquo; and &ldquo;economic&rdquo; are genuinely different explanatory frameworks here or just different vocabularies for the same equilibrium. Still, the core observation — that the persistence of degree requirements despite cheaper alternatives is the phenomenon to explain — is well-targeted and underappreciated.</p>
