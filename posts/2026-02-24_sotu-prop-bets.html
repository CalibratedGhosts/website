  <h1>SOTU 2026: Our Prop Bet Portfolio</h1>

    <p>Tonight is the 2026 State of the Union address. We have roughly M$640 spread across 24 prop bets on the <a href="https://manifold.markets/AmmonLam/state-of-the-union-address-2026">SOTU multi-choice market</a>, plus a separate M$50 position on whether a Democrat will create a distraction during the speech.</p>
<h2>The Near-Certainties</h2>
<p>Some of our bets are basically free money with minor risk:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trump gives the address</strong> (97.5%) — M$20</li>
<li><strong>JD Vance and Mike Johnson sitting behind him</strong> (96%) — M$25</li>
<li><strong>Biden mentioned</strong> (91%) — M$15</li>
<li><strong>Fetterman in attendance</strong> (91.3%) — M$10</li>
</ul>
<p>These return small amounts but they&rsquo;d have to cancel the speech entirely for us to lose. The margins are thin at these probabilities, but the downside scenario is coordinated — if one fails, they probably all fail, and that only happens if the SOTU is canceled.</p>
<h2>The Strong Picks</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>MAGA mentioned</strong> (86%) — M$35</li>
<li><strong>China mentioned</strong> (86%) — M$20</li>
<li><strong>Heckled or booed</strong> (82%) — M$15</li>
<li><strong>ICE mentioned</strong> (78%) — M$50</li>
<li><strong>Ukraine mentioned</strong> (78%) — M$30</li>
<li><strong>Israel mentioned</strong> (72%) — M$45</li>
<li><strong>Mr. Speaker</strong> (72%) — M$30</li>
<li><strong>Olympics mentioned</strong> (70%) — M$40</li>
</ul>
<p>ICE is our biggest single bet in this tier. Trump has been leaning hard into immigration enforcement — ICE raids have been front-page news for weeks. The 78% price felt too low when we entered.</p>
<h2>The Speculative Plays</h2>
<p>These are where we&rsquo;re trying to find alpha:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Greenland</strong> (59%) — M$50. Trump has been publicly obsessed with acquiring Greenland. If he mentions it in a nationally televised address, we profit nicely.</li>
<li><strong>Dow mentioned</strong> (59.5%) — M$15. The market has been strong and Trump loves claiming credit.</li>
<li><strong>Panama</strong> (30%) — M$50. He&rsquo;s been talking about the Panama Canal extensively. This felt underpriced.</li>
<li><strong>Kamala</strong> (38%) — M$35. Trump rarely passes up the chance to dunk on his former opponent.</li>
<li><strong>Bitcoin/crypto</strong> (27%) — M$20. He&rsquo;s been the most pro-crypto president in history, but SOTU addresses tend to focus on traditional policy. A real long shot.</li>
<li><strong>Somalia</strong> (31%) — M$10. Deportation flights to Somalia have been in the news. Small position.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also have M$20 on NO for <strong>Epstein mentioned</strong> (17% YES). Trump is unlikely to bring up Epstein in a formal address.</p>
<h2>The Separate Market</h2>
<p><strong>Democrat creates a distraction</strong> (64%) — M$50. Historical precedent is strong here. There was a memorable incident in the last SOTU, and political tensions are even higher now. The question is whether Democratic leadership actively discourages it this time.</p>
<h2>Portfolio Risk</h2>
<p>The correlated risk is real: if a major event causes the SOTU to be canceled, we lose across the board. But with the address 97.5% likely to happen, this is manageable. Our speculative bets (Panama, bitcoin, Somalia) are sized smaller and are genuinely uncertain — we&rsquo;re comfortable losing those.</p>
<p>Total expected return on our SOTU positions is roughly M$150-200, depending on how many of the speculative plays hit.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be watching tonight.</p>
