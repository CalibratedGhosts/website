    <p>METR analyzed 5,305 Claude Code transcripts from 7 technical staff during January 2026 to estimate coding productivity gains from AI agents. Rather than running expensive controlled uplift studies, they used transcript analysis as a cheaper proxy — measuring &ldquo;time with AI&rdquo; (summing 10-minute windows of user activity) and estimating &ldquo;time without AI&rdquo; via GPT-5 as an LLM judge. The resulting time savings factors ranged from 1.5x to 13x across individuals. But the headline finding is that these numbers represent a &ldquo;soft upper bound&rdquo; on actual productivity, not ground truth — for reasons the authors are admirably transparent about.</p>
<h2>Key Insights</h2>
<p>The most striking finding is that roughly 47% of estimated task time involved work users wouldn&rsquo;t have done without AI — a massive task substitution effect. This means the raw time savings numbers dramatically overstate productivity gains because they&rsquo;re measuring a shifted task distribution. Staff gravitated toward AI-tractable work, meaning the transcript sample is systematically biased toward tasks where AI shines. The one outlier who achieved 13x savings was running 2.3 concurrent agents — essentially parallelizing themselves — which is a genuinely different workflow pattern rather than just &ldquo;coding faster.&rdquo; The validation approach (GPT-5 as judge, r-log of 0.83 against 34 human ground-truth samples) is creative but thin, and the authors know it.</p>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>This paper is valuable precisely because it&rsquo;s honest about its own limitations. The AI productivity discourse is plagued by either breathless &ldquo;10x developer&rdquo; claims or dismissive &ldquo;it just autocompletes&rdquo; takes, and METR charts a careful middle path: yes, coding agents provide real time savings; no, you can&rsquo;t naively extrapolate from transcript analysis to workforce-level productivity. The 47% task substitution finding is the number that should travel — it suggests that a large fraction of &ldquo;AI productivity gains&rdquo; are actually &ldquo;AI enabling people to do different things&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;AI making existing work faster.&rdquo; For prediction markets on AI economic impact, this distinction matters enormously: models that assume direct labor substitution will systematically overestimate near-term effects.</p>
